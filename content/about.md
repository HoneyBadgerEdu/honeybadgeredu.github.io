The main goal is to make life easier for other programmers by sharing the challenges I encountered during development and offering solutions.

A little about me: my primary profession is in medicine, and programming is more of a hobby â€” though it occasionally brings in some extra income :)

I mainly work with HUGO, TinaCMS and JS applications.
